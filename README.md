# Virtual_Vocal_Assistant_Romanian_Multilingual
Virtual Vocal Assistant in Python for Romanian language, other languages can be setup.

Welcome to the first virtual vocal assistant in Romanian language at least, by the time I write this, there are no other solutions on the internet, so I guess it's the first.

Thank you for taking your time to take a look on my project.

Without further and due, without losing your precious time, my solution comes into aid for others or industry related where Google assistant or Siri are not available for their language.

Maybe in need for an industry solution or just as a Bachelor project.

In small terms, the program can recognize your speech(Romanian language, can be setup to others)-perform the tasks that are now in the source code(basic things and easy script so it's very fast{the recognition is about 0.96 average} and can be modified easily to add more functions or other modifications)- and reply on the text given correctly in Romanian language(not in basic index voice that reads in English and your response is written in Romanian, also other languages can be setup)



Please read carefully the instructions within comments in the code. The program runs ok in Pycharm and VScode, others maybe but I didn't check. The program runs ok even as a standalone app+when some simple GUI were added.

I hope I could help.
For any questions or help in the project, please contact me: 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrei-ciuca-34b69a21b/'.

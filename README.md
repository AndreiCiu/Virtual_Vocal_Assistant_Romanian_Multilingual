# Virtual_Vocal_Assistant_Romanian_Multilingual
Virtual Vocal Assistant in Python for Romanian language, other languages can be setup.

Voice assistants have become an increasingly important tool in our daily lives, making it possible to quickly and easily access information, set reminders, make phone calls, and more, all through simple voice commands. The ability to use these assistants in multiple languages is crucial for ensuring that they are accessible to a wider range of people. Being able to use a voice assistant in one's native language can help to eliminate language barriers and make it more intuitive and user-friendly. It also increase its usefulness as it can enable more people to access the benefits of the technology, regardless of their language background. This can be especially beneficial for people who may not be proficient in the dominant language of the region where they live, such as immigrants or non-native speakers.

Moreover, with the increasing globalisation, the ability for the people to communicate in different languages is essential for personal and business advancement. Voice assistant in other languages allows the user to connect with people from different countries, cultures, and communities.

In conclusion, Voice assistants that support multiple languages are essential for ensuring that the technology is accessible to people from all backgrounds and for promoting inclusivity and accessibility for all.

Welcome to the first virtual vocal assistant in Romanian language at least, by the time I write this, there are no other solutions on the internet, so I guess it's the first.

Thank you for taking your time to take a look on my project.

Without further and due, without losing your precious time, my solution comes into aid for others or industry related where Google assistant or Siri are not available for their language.

Maybe in need for an industry solution or just as a Bachelor project.

In small terms, the program can recognize your speech(Romanian language, can be setup to others)-perform the tasks that are now in the source code(basic things and easy script so it's very fast{the recognition is about 0.96 average} and can be modified easily to add more functions or other modifications)- and reply on the text given correctly in Romanian language(not in basic index voice that reads in English and your response is written in Romanian, also other languages can be setup)



Please read carefully the instructions within comments in the code. The program runs ok in Pycharm and VScode, others maybe but I didn't check. The program runs ok even as a standalone app+when some simple GUI were added.

I hope I could help.
